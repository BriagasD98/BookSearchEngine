# BookSearchEngine

My challenge this week was to take a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end.

## Usage
 To use the application, click the link below to go to the **deployed site**. Once you've opened the application, simply enter what kind
 of books you want to search for by key word into the search bar. You may also **login/signup** on the website so you can **save books** that you're interested in.
 You may also **delete saved books** at a later time. User credentials are hashed and protected in a secure database.
